# London
[Vietnam Taste-华苑](https://www.instagram.com/p/CalWAVCrY69/?igshid=ZDFmNTE4Nzc%3D): 4.9/5. It is interesting that its name sounds like they are vietnam food restaurant, but not only they have good pho, their chinese food is really good, I should say that's the best I have ever tasted in Canada, I cannot find other restaurant like that in Toronto.

# Waterloo
[Sushi Star](http://www.sushistarcanada.com/): 4.7/5. They have AYCE, but we just order by menu, their price is pretty cheap compared to the quantity, and taste is fine. worth to go. 

[The Heidelberg Restaurant Tavern & Motel](https://www.oldhh.com/): 4.8/5. Very funny, the store is closed at 7pm on Sunday, when we arrive, it almost closes, so we got two pork hock out. It is very delicious, but it is a pity that I did not buy some beer, tha would be better.
