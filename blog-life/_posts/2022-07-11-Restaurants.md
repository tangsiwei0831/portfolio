# Toronto
[Byblos](https://byblosdowntown.com/): Eastern Mediterranean cuisine, always worth to go to, lamb ribs top recommendation

[OEB](https://eatoeb.com/locations/toronto/?gclid=CjwKCAiAk9itBhASEiwA1my_61YsuBPw7S77-js1K5fg0TCPPQ18PB4cSD6sXOLOaIQ28aTUGCfYiBoCp1YQAvD_BwE): Brunch Restaurant, main dishes are good, glass is tricky, the volume is smaller than what you think

[St Lawrence Market](http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/): I like the crispy pork belly, calamari and lobster sandwhich over there, furits and meats are fresh, good place for shopping and visit

[Lee](https://leerestaurant.com/): Average price 100+, Singapore style SLaw worth to try, other is also ok, worth to go for one time.
